Louise gave an seminar at ENS (Laboratoire de Geologie) about her PhD work at Universite de Rennes with Philippe Steer, Nadaya Cubas and Harsha Bhat. 

She investigated the impact of large erosional events on the seismicity of faults, using quasi-dynamical numerical modeling. She also analysed observations of the change in seismicity after the 2009 typhoon in Taiwan.
