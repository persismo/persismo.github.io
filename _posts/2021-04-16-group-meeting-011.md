During this group meeting, Jinhui presented the work she did during two internships on: 

* the analysis of modes of slip (slow slip and seismic events) in a complex fault network using quasi-dynamic earthquake cycle modeling (presentation is available [here] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/339a4yney89b6db/Pre1_Cheng.pdf?dl=0)). 
* the effect of complex fault geometry on rupture velocity (presentation is available [here] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/g4y2qjh1mphid2b/pre2_Cheng.pdf?dl=0)).
