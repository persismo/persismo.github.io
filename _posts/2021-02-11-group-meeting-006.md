Ekeabino presented his work on the deformation localization in a compressional regime, the ultimate goal being an understanding of the possible contribution of deformational heating towards magma production. 

The meeting took place at ISTeP, with the participation of Laeticia Le Pourhiet, Laurent Jolivet and Nadaya Cubas. 

The slides are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/omokpu9fu92k7b0/Towards%20localization%20in%20a%20compressive%20regime_updated.pdf?dl=0). And some cool videos of Ekeabinos numerical results are available [Overal Temperature](https://www.dropbox.com/s/955ldtfai7devwy/Overall_Temperature_zoom.mov?dl=0),[Shear Stress](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzcsmwacnuntgfj/shearstress_sigma12_zoom.mov?dl=0) and [Strain Rate](https://www.dropbox.com/s/py1du6ru3yqnli2/strainrate_sigma22_zoom.mov?dl=0).
