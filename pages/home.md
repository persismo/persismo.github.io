Welcome to the home page of PERSISMO. PERSISMO is an [ERC funded project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/865411)
aimed at developing state-of-the-art computational models of earthquake cycles.

The project started on January 1, 2021 and will last until December 31, 2025. It is hosted at the 
[Laboratoire de Géologie](http://www.geologie.ens.fr/en/geology-laboratory/) in 
[Ecole Normale Superiéure](www.ens.fr) and managed by the [Centre national de la recherche scientifique](https://www.cnrs.fr/en). 

We will update the website as and when we have interesting news.
